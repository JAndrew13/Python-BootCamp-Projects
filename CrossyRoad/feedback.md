# CrossyRoad Feedback

- No `requirements.txt` file. What packages do I need to install to run this?
  - Looks like there's actually no 3rd party package dependencies.
- No instructions on how to run this game. Probably `python main.py`?
- I like the use of classes in this project
- The game freezes up when I "win".
