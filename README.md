# Python Bootcamp Projects!

This Repository contains some of the projects I created while taking an online Python Bootcamp course. 

The format of the coursework started with a brief lesson of new topics/concepts, followed by a self guided coding period. 

Some of the projects had benchmarks along the way that would allow you to compare code with the instructor, but some were simply a "prompt and go" type project. 

listed below is a brief explanation of each project, along with the concepts covered within the lesson.
