- Missing `requirements.txt`
- Nice use of classes to encapsulate logic
- API keys or other secrets in the code is bad
  - I see Tequila is authenticating using an API code, how is Sheety authenticating?
- I could not get `main.py` to work, even after install the dependencies (`requests` and `twilio`)
